# InkStudio: Tattoo Quote Generator

Welcome to **InkStudio**! This project is designed specifically for tattoo studios looking to streamline the process of providing clients with quick and accurate tattoo quotes. By leveraging the power of AI, InkStudio allows clients to receive a quote within minutes, significantly reducing the back-and-forth communication that typically extends the process to several days. This tool benefits both clients and artists, making the tattoo booking experience more efficient and satisfying for everyone involved.

## Why InkStudio?

Tattoo studios often face the challenge of managing quote inquiries, which can be time-consuming for both the artists and the clients. InkStudio addresses this challenge by providing a rapid, automated way to generate quotes.

### Benefits for Clients

- **Quick Planning:** Clients can get a quote in just a minute, helping them plan their tattoo budget more effectively.
- **Instant Curiosity Fulfillment:** Even those who are just curious about the cost can get immediate answers without the wait.

### Benefits for Artists

- **Time Efficiency:** Artists save valuable time by not having to respond to inquiries manually, especially from clients who may not be serious about getting a tattoo immediately.
- **Focus on Art Creation:** By automating the quoting process, artists can focus more on their creative work and less on administrative tasks.
- **Personalized Scheduling:** Artists only need to engage personally with clients when they decide to schedule a tattoo, making the interaction more meaningful and efficient.

## Project Evolution

InkStudio is an enhancement of my previous project, **InkAssist**, which was the first chatbot developed for this purpose. In this project, I've used advanced techniques to address the limitations of large language models (LLMs), particularly in handling mathematical calculations.

### Technical Highlights

- **Python Decorators:** I've implemented Python decorators to effectively manage and execute the required calculations, providing a robust solution where standard LLM approaches fell short.
- **Integration with LLM:** The combination of Python and LLMs ensures that the system not only provides quick responses but also maintains high accuracy and relevance in the quotes generated.
